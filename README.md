# Electric Vehicle Charging Data Analysis

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior using Python and data visualization.  
It reveals patterns such as peak hours, charging duration, and station utilization.

---

## 🔍 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess EV charging datasets  
- Visualize hourly, daily, and weekly charging patterns  
- Identify usage peaks and low periods  
- Investigate distribution of charging durations  
- Extract insights useful for EV infrastructure planning

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**, **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **NumPy**
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Insights (examples)
- Clear peak charging demand during late afternoons.
- Weekend vs weekday usage patterns differ significantly.
- Stations show uneven load distribution.

---

## 📁 Repository Content
- Jupyter Notebook(s) with analysis
- Plots generated during the study

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Apply clustering (K-means) for usage pattern grouping.
- Predict high-demand periods using ML.
- Build a dashboard using Dash or Streamlit.
